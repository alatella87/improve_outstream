# Improve Outstream

This is an attempt to build an outstream advertising solution based on IMA SDK.

## Getting Started

You need to have <b>python</b> and </b> <b>flask</b> installed, which is used to setup a local server.  

Once python is on your machine, run:

```
pip install Flask
```

Once in the downloaded directory, launch the solution with the following command:

```
python app.py 
```
